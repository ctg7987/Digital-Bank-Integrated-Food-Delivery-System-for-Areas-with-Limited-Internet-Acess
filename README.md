## 🍽️ Overview

This project addresses the digital divide by bringing modern food delivery convenience to underserved regions without reliable internet access. The system allows users to browse restaurant menus, place orders, and make payments through a simple USSD interface, making food delivery accessible to communities previously left behind by digital advancements.

## 🚀 Features

- **📱 Mobile Web Interface**: Beautiful iPhone 16-styled UI for interactive demos
- **Internet-Free Operation**: Uses USSD technology for connectivity
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Supports Visa Card, EcoCash, and Payment on Delivery
- **Restaurant Management**: Easy addition and management of restaurants and menu items
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time order status updates
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean, maintainable C++ architecture
- **Local Integration**: Designed for Zimbabwe with EcoCash payment support
- **Dual Interface**: Both command-line (C++) and web interface (HTML/CSS/JS)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is built using four core classes:

- **`MenuItem`**: Encapsulates menu item properties (name, price)
- **`Restaurant`**: Manages restaurant data and menu items
- **`Order`**: Handles order placement, processing, and tracking
- **`USSDSystem`**: Main controller for user interaction and system coordination

## 🛠️ Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### Implemented OOP Principles:
- **Classes and Objects**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Inheritance**: Base and derived classes for extensibility
- **Function Overloading**: Multiple order placement methods
- **Function Overriding**: Customized behavior for different restaurant types

### Optimization Techniques:
- **Inline Functions**: Performance optimization for frequently accessed methods
- **Function Templates**: Dynamic price comparisons for sorted menu display
- **STL Vectors**: Dynamic memory management for scalable data handling
- **Friend Functions**: Enhanced output formatting and data access

## 📋 Prerequisites

- C++11 or later compiler
- Make utility (for building with makefile)

## 🔧 Building and Running

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended for Demo) 📱

Experience the system with a beautiful iPhone 16-styled mobile interface:

```bash
# Simply open in your browser
open index.html

# Or use a local server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then navigate to: http://localhost:8000
```

> 📖 **Full Guide**: See [WEB_INTERFACE.md](WEB_INTERFACE.md) for complete web interface documentation.

### Option 2: Command Line (C++ Backend)

#### Using Makefile:
```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Run the executable
./food_delivery

# Clean build files
make clean
```

#### Manual Compilation:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Werror -o food_delivery main.cpp MenuItem.cpp Restaurant.cpp Order.cpp USSDSystem.cpp
```

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Run the program**: Execute the compiled binary
2. **Select Restaurant**: Choose from available restaurants in Harare
3. **Browse Menu**: View available items and prices
4. **Place Order**: Select items and quantities
5. **Choose Payment**: Select from Visa Card, EcoCash, or Payment on Delivery
6. **Track Order**: Monitor order status from placement to delivery

## 🎬 Demo
